Additionally, one has to consider the `status` (success or not) of the eventual `response` and the `data format` of the output (to be processed later) (Goodwin, 2024; IBM Technology, 2020).\n",

This is the guide to how the API works and how I can use its functionalities -it explains the protocols for accessing different software applications, making calls and receiving responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this case, the UCDP API is `openly available` and has a `REStful architecture` (Representational State Transfer, a client-server dynamic). This is a standard design and it means it uses `HTTP` (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) communication methods (IBM Technology, 2020). So, the `requests` (queries or petitions to the source) are made via operations under the CRUD logic (create, read, update, delete) (ibid).\n"
