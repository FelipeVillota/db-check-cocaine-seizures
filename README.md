This is a lightweight data validation tool for monitoring entries by the IC team in the shared Google Sheets "incautaciones cocaina 01-02". It is designed to support weekly governance workflows by checking for formatting errors, invalid values, and data quality issues. Highlights problematic rows directly in the sheet and generates structured audit reports for review.
